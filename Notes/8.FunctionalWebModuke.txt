- Alternative programmign model for building RESFUL APIS in Spring WebFlux
- It is an alternative to teh annotation based programming model but otherwise runs on teh same Reactive Core Foundation. 
- Use the following functiona; pgming aspects:
	- Lambdas
	- Method References 
	- Functional Interfaces

- Router: 
	- Restful End points are configured 

- Handler :
	- Code to handle the request

- All RESTFUL APIs endpoints are configured in one single file 
- Code is lighweight compared to the Controller alternative 
- Bean validation is different 
- Exceptionn HAndling is different from the Contoller Approach

- We Earlier we bult the MovieInfoeo Service using Annotated Controller.
- Now we wil lbuild the MoviewRReview Service using Functional Endpoints.


- Path: D:\OneDrive\Study\Java\Spring Web Flux - Reactive MicroServices\reactive-spring-webflux\movies-review-service

- Package Routes:
	- ReviewRouter.java

- Package Handler:
	- ReviewHandler.java

- Delete application.propertis and create application.yml
	- configure server port as 8081

- Delte settings.gradl as else it wil complain the root project is not found
	

- Run MoviesReviewServiceApplication 

- url:  http://localhost:8081/v1/helloworld
